I like to describe it as Create React App on steroids, where it’s an easy way to bootstrap a React application and focus on getting productive with the truly different parts of your application. At its core, it’s a glorified webpack app, where everything gets built upon that same webpack pipeline that you’ve struggled to write and fully understand to this day (or maybe that’s just me).
